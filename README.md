SHIPS AHOY

Description
Ships Ahoy is a game where players try to shoot down as many enemies that they see.
It's a fast paced point and click game where you shoot boats, birds and krakens.
The game ends when the lives come down to 0. 

Main Functionalities
Pirate ships come from the left and right side at the same speed
Pirate ships can be destroyed with 1 click on them.
Pirate ships take one life out of the player if they get to the middle of the screen
Birds come from the right side of the screen and they give more points and one more life to the player
After some time a kraken will appear. If it stays too long on the screen it will take 2 lifes from the player
The Kraken is the most valuable enemy in the game, so you need 10 clicks so it dies.
